Test passed.

### ✅ 07/extract_snippets.sh - Check for triple backticks inside paragraph

Test passed.

Running script without any argument, the input should be read from stdin. This is standard behavior of many Linux utils. Note that this test is optional as the behavior of this specific case was not specified in assignment nor the public tests.

--
```

Test passed.

### ✅ 07/extract_snippets.sh - Nonexistent file among the arguments [correct numbering] (informative test only)

Although it was not precisely specified in the assignment, it is more handy to start numbering for each proceeding file with 01. Note that this test is only optional.
