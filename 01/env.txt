I am using "Elementary OS" so the most obvious choice is to use default DE "Pantheon" ( if i would want to use other DE then there would be no point in using Elementary OS as Pantheon is optimised the best on this OS). So instead I will describe what I like about the Pantheon:

1. It's very eye pleasing, which was a huge plus for me when I was transitioning from Windows to Linux a year ago. (Elementary OS does mock the MacOS but Id rather like it :) ). It also doesnt have "desktop" only a dock at the bottom of the screen with apps what allows to reduce visual noise.

2. Pantheon has a multitasking view, which is quite helful to me when I am designing and creating websites. It can be used in many other different ways but thats the one the most usefull to me.

I also want to ask for an advice: I have tried Kali Linux and Garuda distributions, they have their specific benefits but I've never felt a need to transition to them. Most of my day-to-day task go pretty well on Elementary OS. So, does regular work differ much from distribution to distirbution? What is the reason to use more advanced Linux distros?
