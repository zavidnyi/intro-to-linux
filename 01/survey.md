# Survey of the hardware and software you use

Basically no wrong answers except empty ones ;-).

Each (reasonable) answer is worth 5 points.

**Q1** What is your primary operating system that you use
on your desktop/notebook? Writing a family only is sufficient.
When dual-booting, please name both systems.

**[A1]** I have dual-boot with "Windows 10" and "Elementary OS". I use Windows mainly for gaming and for some programs which are not availiable on Linux. Elementary is my primary workspace for about a year now. **[/A1]**

**Q2** Size of your RAM in gigabytes?
If you have multiple computers, choose just one you use
the most (again, we are interested in desktops/notebooks, not
cell phones or tablets).

**[A2]** 24 GB (3 8GB planks of RAM) **[/A2]**

**Q3** What internet connectivity do you have? Please, specify
rough speeds of upload/download. You can use for example
[SpeedTest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/) to determine the speeds.

**[A3]** Download: 50 MB; Upload: 15 MB/s **[/A3]**
